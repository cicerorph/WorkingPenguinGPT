## Harness the power of ChatGPT-3.5 in your projects! 
*Extension originally made by LOLEMO then forked by Anonymous_cat1.*

## API Note
APIs go up and down every once in a while, so if you get error responses, you should be able to find more reverse proxies here on the internet.
The API used in LOLEMO's version is dead, so I've updated it to use https://api.tmrace.net/v1/chat/completions by default, although you can update it using the "Set Reverse Proxy API URL" block.

Ratelimits are inevitable however, you can get around them with a VPN/Proxy or just waiting a few hours. I may include automatic proxy switching at some point if I ever learn enough JS. lol

## Installation
To use this extension in Turbowarp (or any other Scratch mod that allows custom extensions), open Add Extension > Custom Extension and paste this link
(Note: If you just want to try it out, [try it here!](https://studio.penguinmod.com/editor.html?extension=https://anonymous-cat1.github.io/WorkingTurboGPT/extension.js))

## How to use
If you find that using the extension only reports errors, use this block to update the API URL. (You can find ChatGPT reverse proxies by looking them up)

To simply send a prompt to ChatGPT without any context (chat history), use this reporter:

If you want to use prompts with history (GPT remembers previous messages) you will have to create a chatbot! you can use these blocks to manage (create, delete, and reset) chatbots.
